# EvoVis: Visual Analytics for Labeling Iterations in Data Programming


## Overview

EvoVis is a visual analytics method designed to enhance the understanding of labeling iterations in data programming. It addresses the challenge of interpreting complex relationships among data programming elements, such as labeling data, labeling functions (LFs), and label models. By integrating relationship analysis and temporal overview, EvoVis offers an intuitive and comprehensive approach to evaluate label quality, identify improvement areas, and optimize LFs for high-quality labeled data.

## Key Features

* **Visual Representation of Labeling Iterations:** Displays historical and contextual information on a single screen.
* **Interactive Visualization:** Allows users to explore the evolution of label models, LFs, and labeled data.
* **LF and Data Management:** Facilitates inspection and management of LFs and data, aiding in the identification and rectification of faulty LFs.
* **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Supports evaluating labeled data in terms of accuracy, coverage, balance, and semantic diversity.
